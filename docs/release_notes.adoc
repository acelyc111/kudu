[[rn_1.7.0_upgrade_notes]]
== Upgrade Notes

* Upgrading directly from Kudu 1.6.0 is supported and no special upgrade steps
  are required. A rolling upgrade of the server side will _not_ work because
  the default replica management scheme changed, and running masters and tablet
  servers with different replica management schemes is not supported, see
  <<rn_1.7.0_incompatible_changes>> for details. However, mixing client and
  server sides of different versions is not a problem. You can still
  update your clients before your servers or vice versa.
  When upgrading to Kudu 1.7, it is required to first shut down all Kudu processes
  across the cluster, then upgrade the software on all servers, then restart
  the Kudu processes on all servers in the cluster.

[[rn_1.7.0_obsoletions]]
== Obsoletions

* The `tcmalloc_contention_time` metric, which previously tracked the amount
  of time spent in memory allocator lock contention, has been removed.

[[rn_1.7.0_deprecations]]
== Deprecations

* Support for Java 7 has been deprecated since Kudu 1.5.0 and may be removed in
  the next major release.

[[rn_1.7.0_new_features]]
== New features

* Kudu now supports the decimal column type. The decimal type is a numeric data type
  with fixed scale and precision suitable for financial and other arithmetic
  calculations where the imprecise representation and rounding behavior of float and
  double make those types impractical. The decimal type is also useful for integers
  larger than int64 and cases with fractional values in a primary key.
  See link:schema_design.html#decimal[Decimal Type] for more details.

* The strategy Kudu uses for automatically healing tablets which have lost a
  replica due to server or disk failures has been improved. The new re-replication
  strategy, or replica management scheme, first adds a replacement tablet replica
  before evicting the failed one. With the previous replica management scheme,
  the system first evicts the failed replica and then adds a replacement. The new
  replica management scheme allows for much faster recovery of tablets in
  scenarios where one tablet server goes down and then returns back shortly after
  5 minutes or so. The new scheme also provides substantially better overall
  stability on clusters with frequent server failures.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1097[KUDU-1097]).

* The `kudu fs update_dirs` tool now supports removing directories. Unless the
  `--force` flag is specified, Kudu will not allow the removal of a directory
  across which tablets are configured to spread data. If specified, all tablet
  replicas configured to use that directory will fail upon starting up and be
  replicated elsewhere, provided a majority exists elsewhere.

* Users can use the new `--fs_metadata_dir` to specify the directory in which
  to place tablet-specific metadata. It is recommended, although not
  necessary, that this be placed on a high-performance drive with high
  bandwidth and low latency, e.g. a solid-state drive. If not specified,
  metadata will be placed in the directory specified by `--fs_wal_dir`, or in
  the directory specified by the first entry of `--fs_data_dirs` if metadata
  already exists there from a pre-Kudu 1.7 deployment. Kudu will not
  automatically move existing metadata based on this configuration.

* Kudu 1.7 introduces a new scan read mode READ_YOUR_WRITES. Users can specify
  READ_YOUR_WRITES when creating a new scanner in C++, Java and Python clients.
  If this mode is used, the client will perform a read such that it follows all
  previously known writes and reads from this client. Reads in this mode ensure
  read-your-writes and read-your-reads session guarantees, while minimizing
  latency caused by waiting for outstanding write transactions to complete.
  Note that this is still an experimental feature which may be stabilized in
  future releases.

* The tablet server web UI scans dashboard (/scans) has been improved with
  several new features, including: showing the most recently completed scans,
  a pseudo-SQL scan descriptor that concisely shows the selected columns and
  applied predicates, and more complete and better documented scan statistics.

* Kudu daemons now expose a web page `/stacks` which dumps the current stack
  trace of every thread running in the server. This information can be helpful
  when diagnosing performance issues.

== Optimizations and improvements

* By default, each tablet replica will now stripe data blocks across 3 data
  directories instead of all data directories. This decreases the likelihood
  that any given tablet will be affected in the event of a single disk failure.
  No substantial performance impact is expected due to this feature based on
  link:https://github.com/apache/kudu/commit/60276c54a221d554287c6645df7df542fe6d6443[performance testing].
  This change only affects new replicas created after upgrading to Kudu 1.7.

* Kudu servers previously offered the ability to enable a separate metrics log
  which stores periodic snapshots of all metrics available on a server. This
  functionality is now available as part of a more general “diagnostics log”
  which is enabled by default. The diagnostics log includes periodic dumps of
  server metrics as well as collections of thread stack traces. The default
  configuration ensures that no more than 640MB of diagnostics logs are retained,
  and typically the space consumption is significantly less due to compression.
  The format and contents of this log file are documented in the
  link:administration.html[Administration guide].

* The handling of errors in the synchronous Java client has been improved so that,
  when an exception is thrown, the stack trace indicates the correct location
  where the client function was invoked rather than a call stack of an internal
  worker thread. The original call stack from the worker thread is available as
  a “suppressed exception”.

* The logging of errors in the Java client has been improved to exclude exception
  stack traces for expected scenarios such as failure to connect to a server in a
  cluster. Instead, only a single line informational message will be logged in
  such cases to aid in debugging.

* The Java client now uses a predefined prioritized list of TLS ciphers when
  establishing an encrypted connection to Kudu servers. This cipher list matches
  the list of ciphers preferred for server-to-server communication and ensures
  that the most efficient and secure ciphers are preferred. When the Kudu client
  is running on Java 8 or newer, this provides a substantial speed-up to read
  and write performance.

* Reporting for the `kudu cluster ksck` tool has been updated so tablets and
  tables with on-going tablet copies are shown as "recovering". Additional
  reporting changes have been made to make various common scenarios,
  particularly tablet copies, less alarming.

* The performance of inserting rows containing many string or binary columns has
  been improved, especially in the case of highly concurrent write workloads.

* By default, Spark tasks that scan Kudu will now be able to scan non-leader
  replicas. This allows Spark to more easily schedule kudu-spark tasks local to
  the data. Users can disable this behavior by passing 'leader_only' to the
  'kudu.scanLocality' option."

* The number of OS threads used in the steady state and during bursts of
  activity (such as in Raft leader elections triggered by a node failure) has
  been drastically reduced and should no longer exceed the value of `ulimit -u`.
  As such, it should no longer be necessary to increase the value of `ulimit -u`
  (or of /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max) in order to run a Kudu tablet server in
  most cases.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1913[KUDU-1913]).

* An issue where sparse column predicates could cause excessive data-block reads
  has been fixed. Previously in certain scans with sparsely matching predicates
  on multiple columns, Kudu would read and decode the same data blocks many times.
  The improvement typically results in a 5-10x performance increase for the
  affected scans.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2231[KUDU-2231]).

* The efficiency and on-disk size of large updated values has been improved.
  This will improve update-heavy workloads which overwrite large (1KiB+) values.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2253[KUDU-2253]).


[[rn_1.7.0_fixed_issues]]
== Fixed Issues

* Fixed a scenario where the on-disk data of a tablet server was completely
  erased and and a new tablet server was started on the same host. This issue
  could prevent tablet replicas previously hosted on the server from being
  evicted and re-replicated.
  Tablets now immediately evict replicas that respond with a different server
  UUID than expected.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1613[KUDU-1613]).

* Fixed a rare race condition when connecting to masters during their
  startup which might cause a client to get a response without a CA certificate
  and/or authentication token. This would cause the client to fail to authenticate
  with other servers in the cluster. The leader master now always sends a CA
  certificate and an authentication token (when applicable) to a Kudu client
  with a successful ConnectToMaster response.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1927[KUDU-1927]).

* The Kudu Java client now will retry a connection if no master is discovered as a
  leader, and the user has a valid authentication token. This avoids failure
  in recoverable cases when masters are in the process of the very first leader
  election after starting up.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2262[KUDU-2262]).

* The Java client will now automatically attempt to re-acquire Kerberos
  credentials from the ticket cache when the prior credentials are about to
  expire. This allows client instances to persist longer than the expiration
  time of a single Kerberos ticket so long as some other process renews the
  credentials in the ticket cache. Documentation on interacting with Kerberos
  authentication has been added to the Javadoc for the `AsyncKuduClient` class.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2264[KUDU-2264]).

* Follower masters are now able to verify authentication tokens even if they have never
  been a leader. Prior to this fix, if a follower master had never been a leader,
  clients would be unable to authenticate to that master, resulting in spurious
  error messages being logged.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2265[KUDU-2265]).

* Fixed a tablet server crash when a tablet replica is deleted during a scan.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2295[KUDU-2295]).

* The evaluation order of predicates in scans with multiple predicates has been
  made deterministic. Due to a bug, this was not necessarily the case previously.
  Predicates are applied in most to least selective order, with ties broken by
  column index. The evaluation order may change in the future, particularly when
  better column statistics are made available internally.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2312[KUDU-2312]).

* Previously, the `kudu tablet change_config move_replica` tool required all
  tablet servers in the cluster to be available when performing a move. This
  restriction has been relaxed: only the tablet server that will receive a replica
  of the tablet being moved and the hosts of the tablet's existing replicas need to be
  available for the move to occur.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2331[KUDU-2331]).

* Fixed a bug in the Java client which prevented the client from locating the
  new leader master after a leader failover in the case that the previous leader
  either remained online or restarted quickly. This bug resulted in the client
  timing out operations with errors indicating that there was no leader master.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2343[KUDU-2343]).

* The Unix process username of the client is now included inside the exported
  security credentials, so that the effective username of clients who import
  credentials and subsequently use unauthenticated (SASL PLAIN) connections
  matches the client who exported the security credentials. For example, this is
  useful to let the Spark executors know which username to use if the Spark
  driver has no authentication token. This change only affects clusters with
  encryption disabled using `--rpc-encryption=disabled`.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2259[KUDU-2259]).

[[rn_1.7.0_wire_compatibility]]
== Wire Protocol compatibility

Kudu 1.7.0 is wire-compatible with previous versions of Kudu:

* Kudu 1.7 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.0 or later. If the client uses
  features that are not available on the target server, an error will be returned.
* Rolling upgrade between Kudu 1.6 and Kudu 1.7 servers is believed to be possible
  though has not been sufficiently tested. Users are encouraged to shut down all nodes
  in the cluster, upgrade the software, and then restart the daemons on the new version.
* Kudu 1.0 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.7 with the exception of the
  below-mentioned restrictions regarding secure clusters.

The authentication features introduced in Kudu 1.3 place the following limitations
on wire compatibility between Kudu 1.7 and versions earlier than 1.3:

* If a Kudu 1.7 cluster is configured with authentication or encryption set to "required",
  clients older than Kudu 1.3 will be unable to connect.
* If a Kudu 1.7 cluster is configured with authentication and encryption set to "optional"
  or "disabled", older clients will still be able to connect.

[[rn_1.7.0_incompatible_changes]]
== Incompatible Changes in Kudu 1.7.0

* The newly introduced replica management scheme is not compatible with the
  old scheme, so it's not possible to run pre-1.7 Kudu masters with
  1.7 Kudu tablet servers or vice versa. This is a server-side
  incompatibility only and it does not affect client compatibility. In other words,
  Kudu clients of prior versions are compatible with upgraded Kudu clusters.

**  Kudu masters of 1.7 version will not register Kudu tablet servers of 1.6
    and prior versions.
**  Kudu tablet servers of 1.7 version will not work with Kudu masters of 1.6
    and prior versions.

* The format of the previously-optional metrics log has changed to include a
  human-readable timestamp on each line. The path of the log file has also
  changed with the word “diagnostics” replacing the word “metrics” in the file
  name. The metrics log has been optimized to only include those metrics which
  have changed in between successive samples, and to not include entity attributes
  such as tablet partition information in the log.
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2297[KUDU-2297]).

[[rn_1.7.0_client_compatibility]]
=== Client Library Compatibility

* The Kudu 1.7 Java client library is API- and ABI-compatible with Kudu 1.6. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.6 will compile and run against the Kudu 1.7 client library and
  vice-versa.

* The Kudu 1.7 {cpp} client is API- and ABI-forward-compatible with Kudu 1.6.
  Applications written and compiled against the Kudu 1.6 client library will run without
  modification against the Kudu 1.7 client library. Applications written and compiled
  against the Kudu 1.7 client library will run without modification against the Kudu 1.6
  client library.

* The Kudu 1.7 Python client is API-compatible with Kudu 1.6. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.6 will continue to run against the Kudu 1.7 client
  and vice-versa.

* Kudu 1.7 clients that attempt to create a table with a decimal column on a
  target server running Kudu 1.6 or earlier will receive an error response.
  Similarly Kudu clients running Kudu 1.6 or earlier will result in an error
  when attempting to access any table containing containing a decimal
  column.
